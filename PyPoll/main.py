# You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). 
# *The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 
# *(Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)
# * In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python 
# * Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

#   * The total number of months included in the dataset

#   * The total net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

#   * The average change in "Profit/Losses" between months over the entire period

#   * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

#   * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

# * As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

#   ```text
#   Financial Analysis
#   ----------------------------
#   Total Months: 86
#   Total: $38382578
#   Average  Change: $-2315.12
#   Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
#   Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
#   ```

# * In addition, your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal 
# * and export a text file with the results.
